Assignment 2: Angular/PhoneGap: To Do app

Assignment Breif:

Build a single page to-do list, mobile web application using Angular.js, and package it with PhoneGap Build.

Features and Instructions:

1. Based on an MVC pattern. Your JS app will include a Model (i.e. scope), a View (i.e. HTML file) and a controller (i.e. in a separate js file).

2. “To Do” items will be displayed in a simple HTML list.

3. The app will include a form to add list items.

4. Two-way data binding. Adding an item via the form will update the model and therefore immediately update the view. Hint: Use Angular directives.

5. A config.xml file for PhoneGap. Hint: At the same level as your index.html.

6. A (customized) default icon.

7. Zip your package and upload to a PUBLIC PhoneGap project.

8. Your submission to moodle should contain the same set of files, as well as the QR code generated by PhoneGap. 

Important Notes: •Detailed comments •Appropriate contents in your config.xml •Custom CSS. Make your app distinctive! •Be sure to include your QR code image file when submitting the zip to Moodle.
